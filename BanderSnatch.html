                        <b>1984. Stefan is developing a computer game based on the book 'Bandersnatch', a novel where you get to make choices and this determines the story. He has an opportunity to take his game to Tuckersoft, a software company, and have them release it. However, the more he works on the game the more his life emulates the game, with choices being made that are out of his control. Stefan appears to be going insane.</b>

                       "Fortunately, it works. Bandersnatch is a masterpiece of sophistication. From a user viewpoint, it is seamless... As an experience, it's remarkable. Even more remarkable, though, is the ambition of storytelling on display.
