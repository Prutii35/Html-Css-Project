                                            <span><b>Season 3 - </b></span>In mid-1985, when the box office was dominated by the presence of Back to the Future, Mike and Eleven have developed a romantic relationship, as have Max and Lucas. However, one year after the defeat of the Mind Flayer, things are not all that they seem in Hawkins. The town has a new leader, the morally corrupt Mayor Kline, whose administration supported and presided over the construction of the new Starcourt Mall. With the Fourth of July approaching, strange things start to happen: Lucas' sister Erica discovers a mysterious new threat,[1] and a lifeguard at the community pool suddenly disappears, triggering fear in those that still have the events from the previous year still fresh in their minds.
