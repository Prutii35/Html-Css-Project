                           <p>The setting is 97 years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out almost all life on Earth. Thousands of people live in a space station orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark, constructed of connecting space stations and spacecraft. Three generations have been born in space, bringing the population of the Ark beyond carrying capacity. The future is jeopardized by over-population.</p>

                           <p>100 juvenile detainees are sent to the surface in a last attempt to determine whether Earth is habitable. They discover that some survived the apocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the Reapers, another group of Grounders who have become cannibals; and the Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from those who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership of Bellamy and Clarke, the 100 attempt to survive the harsh surface conditions, battle hostile Grounders and establish communication with the Ark.</p>
