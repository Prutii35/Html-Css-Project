                       <p>In season three, our heroes found themselves at the epicenters of both the Grounder world and the struggle for Arkadia's soul. Despite their best efforts, all out war appeared unavoidable until a new, even more dangerous threat, one that had been quietly rising all along, exploded to the surface: ALIE, the A.I. that ended the world, offered relief from pain and eternal life in the "City of Light," but as her ranks grew, it quickly became clear that she was building an army dedicated to controlling all sentient life on Earth. This was no longer a battle between warring factions; it was a fight for humanity itself.</p>

                        <p>Now, in the wake of the epic season three finale, a hard truth lands on the shoulders of those who remain. What's left to fight for now? Will they go quietly into the night, or will they find hope and faith in each other, as they face their darkest chapter yet?</p>
