                                                <span><b>Season 1 - </b></span>As a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom — and nothing feels the same... Archie Andrews is still the all-American teen, but the summer’s events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music — not follow in his dad’s footsteps — despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale's young music teacher, Ms. Grundy. Which means Archie doesn't have anyone who will mentor him — certainly not singer Josie McCoy, who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It’s all weighing heavily on Archie’s mind — as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones. Meanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she’s not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty’s nerves – which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice – aren't the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge, arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione, there’s an undeniable spark between her and Archie, even though Veronica doesn't want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there’s Cheryl Blossom... Riverdale's Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty, and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows..

                                            <span><b>Season 2 - </b></span>b>The first season of RIVERDALE found our characters reeling from the tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom. For many who had seen their home as perfect, safe, and innocent, the investigation into Jason's murder peeled back the layers of their hometown to reveal a place bubbling over with secrets, mysteries, and scandals. Archie Andrews, for instance, grew from a sweet, all-American kid into a young man acutely aware of the darker side of life—he broke his best friend's heart, had a forbidden relationship with his music teacher, and grappled with whether he wanted to follow in his dad Fred's salt-of-the-earth footsteps. On the positive side, Archie repaired his friendship with Jughead Jones, found some success as a musician—thanks in part to Josie McCoy and her band, the Pussycats—and found a new romantic interest in femme fatale Veronica Lodge. New to town, Veronica spent the season trying to atone for her "bad girl" past, all the while wrestling with her beloved father Hiram's criminal legacy—and contending with a mother, Hermione, who might not be as innocent as she claimed. Veronica became fast-friends with Archie's girl-next-door neighbor, Betty Cooper, who did some growing up of her own this season. After Archie's rejection, Betty threw herself into running the school paper, "The Blue and Gold," where she discovered a better romantic match in sardonic outsider Jughead. Together, they tracked down Betty's sister Polly, who had been sent away by their overbearing mother Alice. Under the guise of writing for the school paper, Betty and Jughead investigated Jason Blossom's death—which led them to discover that Jughead's father—FP Jones —was involved with covering up Jason's murder. Meanwhile, Jason's twin sister Cheryl ruled the school as Riverdale High's venomous, merciless Red Queen—until she learned the true identity of Jason's killer. As the town breathed a collective sigh of relief that Jason's killer had been found out, another terrible crime occurred, in a space that had been considered one of the town's safest, most innocent places. If Jason Blossom's murder revealed the slimy underbelly beneath Riverdale's surface, as we enter Season Two, the shooting of Fred Andrews threatens to plunge the entire town into utter darkness.

                                            <span><b>Season 3 - </b></span>The second season of RIVERDALE picked up moments after Season One's finale, with Fred Andrews (Luke Perry) shot by a mysterious assailant in a black hood—and his son Archie (KJ Apa) racing to save his father's life. No one was safe from The Black Hood's wrath…except for Betty (Lili Reinhart), whose speech at the town's Jubilee “inspired” the Black Hood and made her the object of his murderous obsession.

                                            All of our gang teamed up to stop the Black Hood, including Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse), who also acclimated to a new school and endured a trial-by-fire to become a full-fledged member of his father's gang, the infamous Southside Serpents —even as FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) struggled to get back on the straight and narrow. As Archie and Betty wrestled with the “darkness” the Black Hood had revealed in them, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes) agreed to help her father Hiram (Mark Consuelos) and mother Hermoine (Marisol Nichols) with the “family business,” which pulled her and Archie into a dangerous world of mobsters and criminals. Even star-to-be Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray) was drawn into the Lodge's political machinations. Meanwhile, Queen Bee Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch) was locked in a power-struggle with her mother Penelope (guest star Nathalie Boltt), and found an unlikely ally in Toni Topaz (Vanessa Morgan), a Southside Serpent, who had recently transferred to Riverdale High. Furthermore, Betty and Alice's (Mädchen Amick) lives were turned upside-down when Betty's long-lost brother Chic (guest star Hart Denton) moved into the Cooper house.
                                        
                                             With tensions between the North and Southside at an all-time high—stoked by Hiram Lodge with the help of Reggie Mantle (Charles Melton), and intensified with the Black Hood's unexpected re-emergence—a civil war seemed imminent. And, indeed, after a brief respite during which everyone came together to put on “CARRIE the Musical,” directed by Kevin Keller (Casey Cott), Season Two built to a riot that brought out the worst (and best) of Riverdale and its citizens, and culminated in the shocking arrest of one of our main characters.
